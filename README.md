# DICE (as Hackers)

This repository is used to store codes for DICE. The project is originated from [Hackers](https://www.parkjoohyun.com/Hackers.html), revised and built with Unity.
This project is preferentially invited to the [Tiny Massive](https://tinymassive.io/) exhibition hosted by [Winter Lights Festival 2019](http://www.winterlightsfestival.is/) in Reykjavik.
